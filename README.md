<h2 align="center">Hey, this is Chen.</h2>

I am a full stack programmer. [Ruby on Rails, Java, Go] + [Vue.js, React.js]. For other interesting projects: [Python, C++]

Fun facts:

- Daily Programming: Ruby and Python. Love them.

- Love to refresh algorithm problems. All [my LeetCode solutions](https://github.com/alfmunny/leetcode), updating every week.

- [Color Flood Fill Visualizer](http://alfmunny.com/algorithm-challenges/color-fill/) with pure JavaScript.

- Read programming books, see [my notes](https://github.com/alfmunny/book-notes) of these books. Currently working on "Hands on Machine Learning" and "Fluent Python". Hope I can finish SICP this year as well, a great book.

- Building a [Game Engine](https://github.com/alfmunny/GameEngineMac) is a great way to learn C++ and system design.

- Big fan of Billy Wilder, Akira Kurosawa and Yasujiro Ozu.
