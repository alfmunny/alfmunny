I am a full stack programmer.

For other things: Python, C++

Fun facts:

- Daily Programming: Ruby and Python. Love them.

- Love to solve some programming challenges: take a look at [Color Fill Visualizer](http://alfmunny.com/algorithm-challenges/color-fill/) with pure JavaScript.

- Refresh my knowledge of algorithms in LeetCode, stay tuned on solving problems. All [my leetcode solutions](https://github.com/alfmunny/leetcode), updating every week.

- Read programming books, see [my notes](https://github.com/alfmunny/book-notes) of these books. I am current working on "Hands on Machine Learning" and "Fluent Python". Hope I can finish SCIP this year as well, a great book.

- Building a [Game Engine](https://github.com/alfmunny/GameEngineMac) is a great way to learn programming and C++.
